Of course. Congratulations on the new role! This is an exciting and complex project. You're essentially building a Recommendation and Market Intelligence Engine for a restaurant.

Let's break this down systematically. Your plan to use Rust for the new AI backend is excellent. Rust will give you the performance, safety, and concurrency needed for data processing and machine learning tasks, while it can cleanly integrate with the existing PHP system through HTTP APIs.

High-Level Architecture Overview

Here’s how the systems will interact:

1. The Existing PHP System (The "Brain" of the Restaurant): Handles the main website, menu display, point-of-sale (POS) transactions, order management, and inventory.
2. The New Rust AI Service (The "Strategic Advisor"): A separate service that performs all the data crunching, trend analysis, and recommendation generation. It doesn't hold the "source of truth" for the menu or inventory but provides intelligent suggestions.
3. Communication: The PHP backend will make HTTP requests (e.g., using cURL or Guzzle) to the Rust backend's API endpoints to get recommendations. The Rust service will also have background workers (or async tasks) to periodically scrape the web and analyze data.

Addressing the Core Requirements

Let's map your requirements to technical components.

1. Recommend Additional Recipes for Top-Selling Foods

This is a classic collaborative filtering or content-based recommendation problem.

· Data Needed: Historical order data. (e.g., "People who bought Burger X also bought Milkshake Y").
· Rust Implementation:
  · Create an API endpoint, e.g., GET /api/recommendations/{menu_item_id}.
  · The Rust service will need read-only access to a replica of the order database or receive periodic order data dumps (preferable for security and separation of concerns).
  · You can use a Rust crate like linfa (similar to Python's scikit-learn) to implement a simple model. Start with an Apriori algorithm for association rule learning ("frequently bought together").
  · The PHP system calls this endpoint for each top-selling item on the chef's dashboard to display suggestions.

2. Optimize Stock Based on Trends & Top-Selling Items

This is a predictive analytics problem.

· Data Needed: Current inventory levels, sales velocity of items, and external trend data.
· Rust Implementation:
  · This is a two-part system.
  · Internal Prediction: Analyze the restaurant's own sales data to forecast demand for the next few days. A simple linear regression or time series analysis (using ndarray and linfa) can be a great start.
  · External Trend Integration: Combine this internal forecast with the popularity of ingredients from the trend data (see point 3). If an ingredient is both trending and used in your top sellers, its priority for stocking is high.
  · Expose an endpoint like GET /api/stock_optimization that returns a prioritized list of ingredients and suggested stock levels. The PHP system displays this on a management dashboard.

3. Discover Trending Recipes from the Internet

This involves web scraping and NLP (Natural Language Processing).

· Data Sources: Social media (Twitter, Instagram, TikTok APIs), food blogs, recipe websites, Google Trends.
· Rust Implementation:
  · Rust is perfect for this. Use async HTTP clients like reqwest with tokio for high-performance, parallel scraping.
  · Use crates like scraper (for HTML parsing) and serde (for JSON parsing API responses).
  · For NLP, use a crate like rust-bert (very powerful but complex) or text_embeddings to analyze recipe text, find keywords, and cluster similar trending topics (e.g., "whipped coffee", "smash burgers", "dalgona candy").
  · This would be a background process (a "crawler") that runs periodically (e.g., every 6 hours), stores the results in its own cache (e.g., Redis), and updates a "trending" table in its own database.

4. The Chef's Approval Workflow (PHP-Rust Integration)

This is the critical user interaction point.

1. The PHP backend calls the Rust service: GET /api/trending_recipes.
2. The Rust service returns a list of structured JSON data with trending recipe ideas, their popularity score, source links, and maybe even a predicted list of required ingredients based on NLP.
3. The PHP system displays this list in the "Chef's Tab" in the admin panel.
4. The chef clicks "Accept" on one.
5. The PHP system makes a POST request to its own endpoints to create the new menu item in its database. The Rust service is not the source of truth.
6. (Optional but powerful) The PHP system can then notify the Rust service via a POST /api/menu_updated webhook. This allows the Rust service to update its internal models knowing the menu has changed.

Your Action Plan for Day 1 & Beyond

Phase 1: Foundation and Data Access (Week 1-2)

1. Set up your Rust project. cargo new samzdixon_ai --bin
2. Define your APIs. Use a framework like Actix-web or Rocket. Start by defining the structs (Rust data classes) for your API responses (e.g., TrendingRecipe, Recommendation, StockPrediction).
3. Get read-only access to the PHP database. This is the biggest dependency. You need to understand the schema for Orders, Order_Items, and Menu_Items. The safest way is to get a periodic anonymized data dump or access to a read replica.
4. Build a simple recommendation endpoint. Start by hardcoding some "also bought" logic based on the order data. Prove the connection works.

Phase 2: Internal Intelligence (Week 3-4)

1. Implement the basic recommendation algorithm (e.g., Apriori).
2. Build the sales forecasting model for stock optimization based purely on internal data.
3. Integrate these two features into the PHP admin dashboard. Create simple pages to display the data.

Phase 3: External Intelligence (Week 5-6+)

1. Build your web scraper/crawler. Start with one reliable source (e.g., a recipe API or a specific subreddit). Handle errors and rate-limiting.
2. Process the text to extract key dish names, ingredients, and popularity metrics.
3. Add the trending recipes endpoint and integrate it into the Chef's Tab.

Phase 4: Refinement and Deployment

1. Connect the dots: Let the external trend data influence the stock optimization model.
2. Deploy: You'll need to deploy the Rust service on a server. Docker is highly recommended. You'll create a Dockerfile for your Rust app, and it will run alongside the PHP system, communicating over the internal network.

Example Code Snippet (Rust - Actix-web endpoint)

This gives you a flavor of what the Rust code might look like.

rust
// main.rs
use actix_web::{get, web, App, HttpResponse, HttpServer, Responder};
use serde::Serialize;
use std::sync::Mutex;

// A simple in-memory store for trends (use a DB like PostgreSQL later)
struct AppState {
    trending_recipes: Mutex<Vec<TrendingRecipe>>,
}

#[derive(Serialize)]
struct TrendingRecipe {
    id: u32,
    name: String,
    description: String,
    source_url: String,
    popularity_score: f32,
}

#[get("/api/trending_recipes")]
async fn get_trending_recipes(data: web::Data<AppState>) -> impl Responder {
    let recipes = data.trending_recipes.lock().unwrap();
    // In a real scenario, you'd fetch this from a database populated by your background crawler
    HttpResponse::Ok().json(recipes.clone())
}

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    // Pre-populate with some dummy data
    let dummy_data = web::Data::new(AppState {
        trending_recipes: Mutex::new(vec![
            TrendingRecipe {
                id: 1,
                name: "Dalgona Coffee".to_string(),
                description: "Whipped coffee sensation from TikTok".to_string(),
                source_url: "https://example.com/recipe/123".to_string(),
                popularity_score: 9.5,
            },
        ]),
    });

    HttpServer::new(move || {
        App::new()
            .app_data(dummy_data.clone())
            .service(get_trending_recipes)
    })
    .bind("127.0.0.1:8080")? // Your Rust service runs on port 8080
    .run()
    .await
}


PHP Side (Calling the Rust API):

php
// In the Chef's Tab PHP file
<?php
$rustServiceUrl = "http://localhost:8080/api/trending_recipes";
$trendingData = json_decode(file_get_contents($rustServiceUrl), true);

foreach ($trendingData as $recipe) {
    echo "<div class='recipe'>";
    echo "<h3>{$recipe['name']} (Score: {$recipe['popularity_score']})</h3>";
    echo "<p>{$recipe['description']}</p>";
    echo "<a href='{$recipe['source_url']}' target='_blank'>Source</a>";
    echo "<button onclick='acceptRecipe({$recipe['id']})'>Accept</button>";
    echo "</div>";
}
?>


This is a solid foundation. Start with Phase 1, get the communication flowing, and iterate from there. Good luck tomorrow! You've got this.
